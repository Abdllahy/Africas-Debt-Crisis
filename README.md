# Africa’s Debt Trap — A Data & Forecasting Analysis (2010–2025)

Welcome to the **Africa’s Debt Trap** project — an end-to-end economic analysis that combines **public API data**, **automated ETL pipelines**, and **AI-powered insights** to examine the rising debt burden across African nations. As a data analyst and aspiring AI practitioner, I built this system to uncover macroeconomic risks, promote financial transparency, and enable data-driven decision-making for governments, researchers, and citizens.

## Project Objectives

The main goals of this project were to:

- Track and visualize **public debt metrics** across African countries from 2010–2025.
- Build an **automated data pipeline** that fetches and stores economic data from public APIs.
- Explore **debt-to-GDP ratios**, lender exposure (e.g. China, IMF), inflation, and currency depreciation.
- Uncover correlations between debt, **austerity measures**, and **political protests**.
- Develop a **forecasting tool** to predict fiscal risk using machine learning.
- Provide a **public-facing dashboard** for decision-makers and citizens.

## Project Overview

As of 2025, many African nations are grappling with unsustainable debt levels. Loans from external lenders, including China and the IMF, have increased exponentially, while economic shocks like COVID-19 and currency volatility have worsened the crisis. Yet, public access to real-time debt insights remains limited.

This project addresses that by:

- Collecting multi-source data (World Bank, IMF, SAIS-CARI, TradingEconomics).
- Building an ETL pipeline to clean, transform, and load debt indicators.
- Running time-series forecasts for debt levels and inflation.
- Analyzing economic protest data scraped from global news.
- Visualizing macroeconomic trends across Africa in a single dashboard.

---

## Key Findings

- External debt in Sub-Saharan Africa has tripled since 2010.
- Countries like Zambia, Ghana, and Kenya face **severe debt stress**.
- Chinese loans dominate the infrastructure financing landscape.
- Debt-to-GDP ratios above 70% often align with **currency devaluation** and **bond yield spikes**.
- Protests related to fuel prices and austerity are **closely correlated** with debt spikes.
